Installing Mellivora
=========

People run Mellivora on various configurations. Feel free to follow one of our setup guides below:

 - [LAMP](lamp/README.md) (Ubuntu, Apache, MySQL, PHP). This is the officially supported configuration. Also contains ngix config example.
 - [Caddy](caddy/README.md) (Ubuntu, Caddy, MariaDB, PHP).

If you have set up Mellivora on a different environment, consider adding a guide to help others!
